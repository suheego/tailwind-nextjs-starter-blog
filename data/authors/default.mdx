Amber is a software engineer. Currently works for a company in the healthcare sector, focusing on backend development.

I've worked in a variety of industries over the years, including commerce, fintech, and social, and I want to focus on how technology can enrich the lives of individuals.

In development, I love working with my co-workers to solve problems. I can communicate well with non-developers and prefer to keep things fun.
